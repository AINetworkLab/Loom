This benchmark suite comprises 30 numerical computation programs with static control flow, designed to evaluate the performance disparities across different WebAssembly (Wasm) runtimes under varying compilation and execution modes (JIT, AOT, and interpreter) when processing identical tasks. The benchmarks assess key computational metrics, including numerical processing speed, file I/O throughput, and memory access efficiency. Among them, 16 benchmarks are sourced from PolyBench, while the remaining 14 are custom-developed. The suite covers a diverse range of application domains, such as linear algebra computations, image processing, physical simulations, dynamic programming, and statistical operations. Currently, WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation is provided.
